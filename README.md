# Enhance Security Posture

### Introduction
In today’s increasingly digital world, businesses operating in a hybrid environment—both on-premises and cloud—face unique security challenges. A medium-sized company with budget constraints must improve its security posture through a strategic and phased approach. This project outlines a comprehensive strategy, incorporating industry standards, best practices, and security frameworks, to protect sensitive data and reduce the risk of cyberattacks over a 12-month period.

## Security Strategy

### 1. Frameworks and Standards:

- OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) will be a key reference point for addressing web vulnerabilities, while Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) will guide patching and mitigation of known threats.
- Implement industry standards such as ISO/IEC 27001 for Information Security Management and NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) Cybersecurity Framework to ensure robust risk management practices.
- Ensure compliance with GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), particularly in managing personal data, implementing access controls, and reporting incidents.

### 2. Security Tools:

- SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) solutions like Microsoft Sentinel will be used for centralized logging and real-time threat detection across hybrid environments.
- EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) tools like Microsoft Defender for Endpoints will be critical in detecting and mitigating endpoint threats, providing visibility across the network.
- Ensure regular Windows updates to protect the company from vulnerabilities and threats disclosed in CVEs.

### 3. Server and Website Hardening:

- Apply OWASP’s recommendations to secure web applications, including proper configurations, patching, and secure coding practices.
- Harden servers by disabling unnecessary services, applying the principle of least privilege, and ensuring encryption protocols like TLS are in place.
- Utilize secure baseline configurations, leveraging Microsoft’s Security Compliance Toolkit for Windows and server environments.

### 4. Employee Training:

- Implement a continuous employee awareness and training program focused on phishing, social engineering, and secure behavior using Proofpoint or similar platforms.
- Incorporate gamified simulations to boost engagement and foster a security-first culture across departments.

### 5. Access Controls and Least Privilege:

- Ensure least privilege access across systems and services, with regular reviews of access rights to minimize insider threats.
- Utilize Privileged Access Management (PAM) solutions for secure access to critical systems.

### 6. Use of MITRE ATT&CK Framework:

- Leverage MITRE ATT&CK for identifying tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by adversaries.
- Focus on detection and response measures, mapping threats to specific TTPs and enhancing visibility into adversary behavior through the EDR and SIEM solutions.

## Implementation Roadmap

### Month 1: Initial Security Assessment

- Conduct a comprehensive security assessment using the NIST framework to evaluate the current security posture.
- Identify gaps in infrastructure, endpoint security, access controls, and user behavior.

### Month 2: SIEM and EDR Deployment

- Deploy Microsoft Sentinel and Microsoft Defender for Endpoints to enhance threat detection, monitoring, and response capabilities across the hybrid environment.

### Month 3: Server and Website Hardening

- Apply security hardening measures to servers and websites, following OWASP and NIST guidelines for secure configuration and patch management.

### Month 4: Policy Updates and Enforcement

- Update security policies to reflect best practices in access controls, incident response, and secure coding.
- Ensure policies align with GDPR and ISO 27001 requirements.

### Month 5: Employee Training Sessions

- Begin monthly cybersecurity training focused on phishing, social engineering, and secure behaviors.
- Conduct simulated phishing attacks to evaluate employee response and improve awareness.

### Month 6: Mid-Year Security Audit

- Conduct an internal audit to assess the effectiveness of the deployed security tools and policies.
- Identify any remaining gaps and adjust the strategy for the second half of the year.

### Months 7-9: Continuous Monitoring and Incident Response Testing

- Continuously monitor the environment using SIEM and EDR data.
- Conduct regular incident response drills to test the readiness of the team and the technology.

### Months 10-12: Final Audit and Reporting

- Perform a final security audit to evaluate the company’s compliance with ISO 27001, NIST, and GDPR standards.
- Provide a report to management on the overall improvement in the security posture and plan for continuous improvement beyond the first year.


## Collaboration with IT and Management Teams

Throughout the implementation process, collaboration with IT and management will be essential:

- IT Teams: Work closely with IT for technical deployments, server hardening, and incident response efforts.
- Management Teams: Keep management informed through regular updates, highlighting milestones achieved and ensuring alignment with the company’s business goals.

## Conclusion
Improving the security posture of a medium-sized company operating in a hybrid environment requires a well-defined strategy, leveraging industry standards and security frameworks like OWASP, NIST, and MITRE ATT&CK. By deploying the right security tools, training employees, and continuously assessing risks, the company can significantly reduce vulnerabilities and strengthen its defenses over the course of one year.
